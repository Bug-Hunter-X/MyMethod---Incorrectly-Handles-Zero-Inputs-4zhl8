# C# Code Bug: Incorrect Zero Input Handling in MyMethod()

This repository demonstrates a common error in C# code: improper handling of zero inputs in a function.

The `MyClass.cs` file contains a `MyMethod()` function that fails to correctly handle cases where both input parameters `a` and `b` are zero.  This leads to unexpected behavior or potential exceptions.

The `MyClassSolution.cs` file provides a corrected version that addresses this issue by explicitly checking for and handling the case where both inputs are zero. 

This example highlights the importance of comprehensive input validation and error handling in robust software development.
